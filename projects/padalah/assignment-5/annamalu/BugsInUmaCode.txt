I used both my unit and random tests that I wrote for my own application. 
I identified the bugs by using these tests and seeing which tests failed and trying new tests. 
Then I compared this with the java code of the class I was testing to find the main issues. Also when
I ran the test with mvn test, my tests failed and I was given where the failures occured and what 
the expected and current values were.
I found three bugs through this process:
    1.	Bug 1: In Appt, when the description is set the description is set to null when a valid string is entered or “” 
    is it is an empty string is getting set because the if condition checks if it isn’t null not if is null. 
    This bug has a huge impact because the description is never being set so no appointment has a description. 
    I found this when I set the description and used assert functions to get the description.
    Severity: High
    Priority: High
    2.	Bug 2: In Appt, in the isValid function when getting the number of days in a month, the wrong month is being call. 
    This is because the month should be subtracted by one but it isn’t so it is being checked against the right month. 
    I found this error because I tested the 12 month but I kept getting a test failure because that wasn’t the right number 
    of days that were being returned because it was being read as that is an out of bound exception.
    Severity: High
    Priority: High
    3.	Bug 3: In CalDay, when the month is set the month is set to day instead of month. 
    This messes up the month that is set up by the calDay. 
    I found this error by setting this month and using the getter function to assert that the right month 
    was being set which it wasn’t being set.
    Severity: Moderate
    Priority: High
